This Project defines simple Authentication and Authorization 
I prefered to use Microsoft Identity Options to make more safe authentication and authorization process
Used password hash, securitystamp , antiforgerytoken,validation and other Identity Options
There're only one Admin can see AdminDashboard , simple users are only abel to see simple page (u can modify it)
